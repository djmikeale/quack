_This repo is a self-contained dwh, utilizing DuckDB, some shell scripting, and more._

Built on top of [dbt's duckDB jaffle shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop_duckdb)

This repo contains [seeds](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/seeds) that includes some (fake) raw data from a fictional app along with some basic dbt [models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models), tests, and docs for this data.

The raw data consists of customers, orders, and payments, with the following entity-relationship diagram:

## Browsing the data

</summary>

Launch a DuckDB command-line interface (CLI):
```shell
duckcli jaffle_shop.duckdb
```
Run a query at the prompt and exit:
```
select * from customers where customer_id = 42;
exit;
```
Alternatively, use a single-liner to perform the query:
```shell
duckcli jaffle_shop.duckdb -e "select * from customers where customer_id = 42"
```
or:
```shell
echo 'select * from customers where customer_id = 42' | duckcli jaffle_shop.duckdb
```

Furthermore, the following options exist:
- [DuckDB CLI](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/?environment=cli)
- [How to set up DBeaver SQL IDE for DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/sql_editors/dbeaver)

## Bells and whistles

</summary>

There's some bells and whistles defined in the [.devcontainer.json]().devcontainer.json) that are worth calling out. Also a great reference is the [Setting up VSCode for dbt](https://dbt-msft.github.io/dbt-msft-docs/docs/guides/vscode_setup/) guide.

1. there is syntax highlighting provided by the `vdcode-dbt` extension. However, it is configured such that files in your `target/run` and `target/compiled` folder are not syntax highlighted, as a reminder that these files are not where you should be making changes!
2. basic `sqlfluff` linting is enabled as you type. Syntax errors will be underlined in red at the error, and will also be surfaced in the **Problems** tab of the Terminal pane. It's configured to lint as you type.
3. Autocompletion is enabled for generic dbt macros via the `vdcode-dbt` extension. For example, if you type `macro` you'll notice a pop up that you can select with the arrow keys then click tab to get a macro snippet.

4. the `find-related` extension allows an easy shortcut to navigating using `CMD`+`R`to jump from
    - a model file to it's corresponding compiled version,
    - from a compiled file to either the original model file or the version in `target/run`
5. The `vscode-yaml` YAML, combined with the JSON schema defined in [dbt-labs/dbt-jsonschema](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-jsonschema), autocomplete options while working with dbt's YAML files: i.e. :
    - Project definition files (`dbt_project.yml`)
    - Package files (`packages.yml`)
    - Selectors files (`selectors.yml`)
    - Property files (`models/whatever.yml`)
