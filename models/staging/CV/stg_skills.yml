      # Description
      The tools I've used which might be relevant for you to know.

      ## Lol
      Got the following error when calling the source raw_skills so naturally had to change it:
      Binder Error: Table 'raw_skills' does not have a column with name 'level_example'
    columns:
      - name: skill
        description: ""
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

      - name: abbreviation
        description: |
          If the abbreviation is more common than the skill name, it's listed here.

          ...because SQL Server Integration Services doesn't roll of your tongue very easily.
